There are a few existing tools to access and publish nanopublications.

## 🌐 Web service

### 🛋️ Nanodash

[**Nanodash**](https://github.com/knowledgepixels/nanodash) is the official web service to browse and publish nanopublications is

### 🔬 Knowledge Collaboratory 

The [Knowledge Collaboratory](https://collaboratory.semanticscience.org/) is a service to help annotate biomedical text, publish those annotations as nanopublications, and browse nanopublications.

## 📚️ Libraries

Libraries in various languages are available to manipulate and publish nanopublications:

### ☕️ Java libraries

[**nanopub-java**](https://github.com/Nanopublication/nanopub-java) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04977)): the official implementation to sign, verify, and publish nanopubs.

### 🐍 Python libraries
